            <h2>Growth, Creativity, Pain, Suffering</h2>
            <h3>September 15, 2024</h3>
            <p>
		Dr. Martha Beck wrote a book called “The Way of Integrity”,  with the goal of helping people get in touch with their True Self and express it to the world. As far as I know, she’s borrowing concepts first described by Carl Jung, the founder of psychoanalysis, who writes about the ideas of the Self and Ego. A quick summary of these concepts:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Self: our internal blueprint that we’re born with and is unique to us. This is the source of our intuition, dreams, and vision.</li>
			<li>Ego: our outward appearance to the outside world, which is modulated by our conscious thinking.</li>
		</ul>
		Jung, Dr. Beck, and Julie Cameron - the author of “The Artist’s Way” - argue that our mental struggles are the result of our Ego - the outward projection of our self - being out of sync from our Self. They all use different words to describe this idea. Jung calls it suppression. Dr. Beck calls it socialization. Cameron calls it being blocked. In each case, the core idea is this: We have an inner “us” that wants to exist in the world and we suffer when we don’t let that happen. 
		<br><br>
		The teachers argue that our culture socializes us away from our inner self, meaning we modify our behavior according to the expectations of those around us. We learn to do this at an early age when we’re vulnerable and depend on others to meet our basic needs. This behavior modification is smart when we’re young but can be problematic if it chronically stunts the expression of our inner self as we age. Chronically stunting our inner self manifests as mental suffering, and the only way out of the suffering is through growth. 
		<br><br>
		A lot can be said on growth. To me, growth means learning to express our inner self to the outside world, in any circumstance, using creativity. I’d like to focus on growth through the lens of pain. Growth and suffering are connected to each other through pain and are easy to confuse, yet they are extremely different and their distinction is worth noting.
		<br><br>
		The distinction is this: Growth is the expansion of capabilities, whereas suffering is the diminishment of capabilities. Both are painful experiences. Growing pain comes from our inner self expanding outward against the pressure of the world, while suffering pain comes from our inner self contracting from world. Dr. Beck puts it succinctly, “Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional”.
		<br><br>
		Suffering comes from the stories we tell ourself, so we can choose to not suffer by telling ourselves a different story. When our inner self does not yet exist in the world, we do not need to suffer for it. We must move through pain, but we can do so through the pain of growth. We do this by choosing creativity over suffering. It’s a choice.

            <h2>Before and After</h2>
            <h3>September 14, 2024</h3>
            <p>
            I’m having a great time at Running Man. Here’s my concise attempt to describe it: a music festival crossed with a marathon hosted at your rich friend’s dad’s house. It has a festival ground with a main stage and food and merch vendors like a music festival, has a race course - a 1 mile field track - looping around the festival grounds with health and fitness food and product vendors, and there’s a ton of free and healthy drinks and snacks you can grab from tables and fridges all while being hosted by the most friendly and outgoing guys you can imagine. Oh yeah, and there’s a massive sauna - like 10 burning stoves - and about 10 cold plunges that are free to use. There’s more to share about this running festival, like what I learned from an interview with a coach that’s done 40+ Ironman races, a panel on summiting mount Everest, the host Jesse Itzler’s opening talk, and Mike Posner’s post-race set (not to mention what might happen tomorrow). I’ll get into more details later.
			<br><br>
			A thing I’ve been thinking about lately is the idea of the “before and after” of something, which is often overlooked when we discuss things that require physical presence. Take exercise, for example. Infomercials and fitness gurus love saying things like, “my program only requires 20 minutes a day that you can do from home!“ Sure, the exercise class may last 20 minutes, but that doesn’t account for the time it takes to change into your gyms clothes and shower and change after, so including the before and after it’s really closer to double that. In a more positive example, the before and after of run clubs is my favorite part, especially the after. After running is when you get lunch or drinks and wind down with your running partners and chat. That’s why cafes are so great in bookstores and fitness studios, because they capture and amplify the calm of the before and after of shopping or yoga. 
			<br><br>
			Capitalizing on the before and after is an amazing way to expand an experience. For a family vacation that requires a road trip or flight, start the vacation during that travel time and play games or bring snacks. On the way to Running Man I carpooled with attendees I met in a group chat, so I started making friends four hours before the event started (we stopped for breakfast). I’m doing the same when I leave. Experiences are so much more than the principle activity because of the before and after. 
			<br><br>
			I think that’s part of the reason I enjoyed traveling so much - the before and after of being somehwere is usually the solitude of a flight (plus the before and after of a flight). While my draw to, and withdrawal from, travel is a complex evolution, part of that shift is I’m valuing connection over solitude. I’m beginning to view travel as a severence of connection rather than an opportunity for solitude and reconnection. 
			<br><br>
			My proclivity for splitting time between multiple places (i.e. living nomadically) is another topic I’m interested in exploring further.

            <h2>Cracking Through Walls</h2>
            <h3>September 13, 2024</h3>
            <p>
            I’m on my way to Running Man, a 3-day event focused on fitness and wellbeing where the marque event is a choose-your-own-distance race around a 1-mile track the circles the outdoor venue. I’ve committed to running a marathon, my first. It’s scheduled to rain all weekend, which will make for an interesting weekend. Best case it turns the weekend into a massive, muddy, slip-and-slide summer camp vibe session filled with laughter and new friends. Worst case the makeshift venue of stages and vendors and tents can’t withstand the constant rain and the infrastructure crumbles and the air is filled with Fyre-festival vibes. In either case I can personally choose which type of weekend I want, so I’m going for the slip-and-slide version. We’ll see how many other runners choose this option, too. Given the crowd I’ve seen in videos and in the event’s group chat, I think most people will join me.
			<br><br>
			Turning my attention to the marathon piece, I’m looking forward to pushing myself to the farthest distance I’ve ever run in one go. The longest run I’ve done so far is the Big Sur 21-mile race. During that race I hit a mini wall at mile 15 and a big wall at mile 18. These walls are interesting. They are moments when my body, especially my legs, and my mind said they were done. My pace dropped drastically, my breathing shifted, and my mind started to think about the boring pain of continuing to run, which sapped my will to move on.
			<br><br>
			Running in that headspace sucks. But getting out of it is amazing. 
			<br><br>
			Getting out of that head space is not a dramatic moment. I initially want to think of that moment as “breaking through” the wall, but the shift out is not an acute, explosive break. It’s more like a “cracking” through the wall. I’ll explain.
			<br><br>
			The moment I start to climb out of this painful headspace of “my body is cooked” is the moment I gain awareness over some aspect of my body and exert willful control. It’s when I become more aware of my breathing pattern or my running form. Once my awareness takes hold of one of these patterns, I start to experiment with toggling that pattern. I might slow down my breathing, change my inhale-exhale rythym, or I might try lengthen my stride. Inevitably, this mindful physical adjustment creates a different physical experience that lessens the pain and increases pleasantness. The enduring pain corners my awareness to focus on the control I have over my physical experience. Even if the new physical experience remains a challenge, knowing I have the power to make adjustments is invigorating and gives me the energy to continue running. It starts with the crack of awareness.
			<br><br>
			Awareness is such a powerful tool. Expanding our awareness beyond it’s typical domain is the hallmark of curiousity, learning, and open mindedness. However, expanding our awareness is extremely difficult to do without a mechanism that exposes our minds to the possibility of an experience outside of our awareness. I’ll call this the “outside”.
			<br><br>
			I’d like to expand on this idea of the “outside”. The outside can be a challenging place to go. I wonder what the psychology is behind open mindedness and willingness to expand one’s awareness. I imagine we are hardwired to be suspicious and fearful of the outside, and that certain conditions must be met in order for us to be comfortable exploring the outside. I expect attachment theory to play a role here. For instance, a child is more likely to engage in an unfamiliar environment if they are securely attached to a nearby caregiver.
			<br><br>
			I’m looking forward to thinking more about this.

            <h2>Cynicism & Wicked Learning</h2>
            <h3>September 12, 2024</h3>
            <p>
                According to Dr. Jamil Zaki, cynicism is a worldview in which the believer, called a cynic, believes that people are inherently greedy, selfish, and untrustworthy. A cynic believes everyone’s actions are driven by selfishness and that trusting others will lead to being taken advantage of. Cynics start to monitor others’ behavior for untrustworthiness as a form of perverse confirmation bias. In turn, people feel uncomfortable around cynics. It’s no wonder that cynics live more isolated lives and are less connected to friends and loved ones.
                <br><br>
                Having grown up around cynics, I can attest to the discomfort.
                <br><br>
                Interestingly, cynicism is a form of “wicked learning”, which is the idea that some negative beliefs become self-reinforcing because they prevent any challenges to the belief. For example, cynics believe people are untrustworthy so they never fully trust anyone. Because they never fully trust anyone, they never give themself the chance to experience trust and reverse their belief. In other words, prior learning prevents future learning. The adopted belief becomes frozen and unthaw-able.
                <br><br>
                The wicked learning of cynicism is tragic and makes it so hard to reverse. Dr. Zaki offers a few strategies to combat cynicism:
                <ol>
                    <li>Adopt a skeptical mindset of your beliefs. If your gut reaction is to not trust somebody, challenge that belief.</li>
                    <li>Engage in reciprocity. People tend to reciprocate behaviors - for example polite manners are responded to with polite manners - so if you are proactively trusting with someone it will encourage them to be trusting back.</li>
                    <li>Savor social moments of trust. Be mindful of moments in every day life where you witness people acting selfless for one another, and recognize that most people are looking out for one another.</li>
                </ol>
                Cynics learn their belief either through direct experience or indirectly from having the belief repeated to them over and over. I fell into the latter camp. 
                <br><br>
                I’ll make a connection to something Dr. Paul Conti, a psychiatrist, says about trauma. He define trauma as something that overwhelms your defense system and changes your behavior. Dr. Conti explains that trauma can be experience acutely (a major event like an accident), chronically (small events repeated over time), or empathically (absorbing someone else’s trauma through long exposure to their experience, like what a therapist might experience). This makes me wonder if cynicism would be considered a form of trauma according to Dr. Conti, as it’s an adopted belief that lodges itself in the believers brain and alters their behavior. 
                <br><br>
                I consider myself a recovering cynic.

            <h2>Emotional Intelligence </h2>
            <h3>September 11, 2024</h3>
            <p>
            According to Dr. Marc Brackett’s, the Director of the Yale Center of Emotional Intelligence, Emotional intelligence is how we reason with and about our emotional feelings. Emotional intelligence can also be thought of as a set of skills, summarized by the acronym RULER:
            <ul>
                <li>Recognizing emotions - reading them in yourself and in others</li>
                <li>Understanding emotions - understand where they are coming from and their consequence</li>
                <li>Labeling emotions - being precise with the words we use to describe our feelings</li>
                <li>Expressing emotions - knowing how and when to express emotions to different people</li>
                <li>Regulating emotions - the strategies we use to manage daily emotions</li>
            </ul>
            When we don’t have these skills, we can’t manage our emotions and we develop behaviors of suppression, denying, ignoring, isolating, and habits of distraction like eating. In order to better cope with our emotions, Dr. Brackett argues we need ”permission to feel”. We need somebody to create safe conditions for us to experience and express our emotions. Dr. Brackett calls that person an Emotion Mentor, and says they needs three qualities:
            <ol>
                <li>Be nonjudgmental</li>
                <li>Be an active listener</li>
                <li>Be compassionate</li>
            </ol>
            In a similar narrative, Dr. Becky Kennedy has a parenting book called “Good Inside” in which she argues that emotional regulation (the last “R” of RULER) is the most important skill for a parent to teach their child. Dr. Kennedy explains that children learn emotional regulation by modeling their parents’ behavior. For instance, when a child is emotionally disregulated - meaning their emotions are overwhelming their bodies and exploding in uncontrollable behavior -  the parent must maintain their composure and establish a presence of, calm, in-control authority. This position from a parent demonstrates to the child that their emotions are not overwhelming to the parent and, therefore, are possible to be managed.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Kennedy offers this three-step process to regulating our emotions:
            <ol>
                <li>Acknowledge the emotion (Ex. saying out loud, “hello, anxiety”)</li>
                <li>Validate the emotion (Ex. Saying out loud, “I’m feeling anxious, this makes sense given the situation”)</li>
                <li>Permit the emotion (allow yourself to feel it, don’t ignore or suppress it, say “I can cope with it“)</li>
            </ol>
            I find the study of emotions fascinating and will continue to learn more about the topic. Reflecting on my personal experience with emotional intelligence, I would say I didn’t have an Emotion Mentor (according to Dr. Brackett, 70% of adults didn’t have one). I managed my emotions using isolation and eating copious amounts of Smartfood popcorn. Growing up I struggled with low emotional intelligence, a fixed mindset, and a cynical worldview. Not the best cards to play with. Over the years I’ve worked to improve my EQ, adopt a growth mindset, and reverse my cynical perspective. I enjoy learning the psychology behind these topics so I can better understand my past and apply the learnings and takeaways to improve my future.
