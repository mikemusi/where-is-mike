                    <li>We come from nature and will return to nature. Nature is a creative force that is always growing and seeking balance.</li>
                    <li>Integrity is being true to our Self. We are born with our world inside us, and we choose what to express and suppress. Living with integrity means honoring our inner world with our outer world actions.</li>
                    <li>Trust is believing that others care for our wellbeing. Trust let's us be vulnerable and connected to others, and is required to feel a sense of belonging.</li>
                    <li>The purpose of life is creativity, which is the act of realizing our imagination. </li>
                    <li>Growth is the continued pursuit of creativity.</li>
