            <h2>Cynicism & Wicked Learning</h2>
            <h3>September 12, 2024</h3>
            <p>
                According to Dr. Jamil Zaki, cynicism is a worldview in which the believer, called a cynic, believes that people are inherently greedy, selfish, and untrustworthy. A cynic believes everyone’s actions are driven by selfishness and that trusting others will lead to being taken advantage of. Cynics start to monitor others’ behavior for untrustworthiness as a form of perverse confirmation bias. In turn, people feel uncomfortable around cynics. It’s no wonder that cynics live more isolated lives and are less connected to friends and loved ones.
                <br><br>
                Having grown up around cynics, I can attest to the discomfort.
                <br><br>
                Interestingly, cynicism is a form of “wicked learning”, which is the idea that some negative beliefs become self-reinforcing because they prevent any challenges to the belief. For example, cynics believe people are untrustworthy so they never fully trust anyone. Because they never fully trust anyone, they never give themself the chance to experience trust and reverse their belief. In other words, prior learning prevents future learning. The adopted belief becomes frozen and unthaw-able.
                <br><br>
                The wicked learning of cynicism is tragic and makes it so hard to reverse. Dr. Zaki offers a few strategies to combat cynicism:
                <ol>
                    <li>Adopt a skeptical mindset of your beliefs. If your gut reaction is to not trust somebody, challenge that belief.</li>
                    <li>Engage in reciprocity. People tend to reciprocate behaviors - for example polite manners are responded to with polite manners - so if you are proactively trusting with someone it will encourage them to be trusting back.</li>
                    <li>Savor social moments of trust. Be mindful of moments in every day life where you witness people acting selfless for one another, and recognize that most people are looking out for one another.</li>
                </ol>
                Cynics learn their belief either through direct experience or indirectly from having the belief repeated to them over and over. I fell into the latter camp. 
                <br><br>
                I’ll make a connection to something Dr. Paul Conti, a psychiatrist, says about trauma. He define trauma as something that overwhelms your defense system and changes your behavior. Dr. Conti explains that trauma can be experience acutely (a major event like an accident), chronically (small events repeated over time), or empathically (absorbing someone else’s trauma through long exposure to their experience, like what a therapist might experience). This makes me wonder if cynicism would be considered a form of trauma according to Dr. Conti, as it’s an adopted belief that lodges itself in the believers brain and alters their behavior. 
                <br><br>
                I consider myself a recovering cynic.

            <h2>Emotional Intelligence </h2>
            <h3>September 11, 2024</h3>
            <p>
            According to Dr. Marc Brackett’s, the Director of the Yale Center of Emotional Intelligence, Emotional intelligence is how we reason with and about our emotional feelings. Emotional intelligence can also be thought of as a set of skills, summarized by the acronym RULER:
            <ul>
                <li>Recognizing emotions - reading them in yourself and in others</li>
                <li>Understanding emotions - understand where they are coming from and their consequence</li>
                <li>Labeling emotions - being precise with the words we use to describe our feelings</li>
                <li>Expressing emotions - knowing how and when to express emotions to different people</li>
                <li>Regulating emotions - the strategies we use to manage daily emotions</li>
            </ul>
            When we don’t have these skills, we can’t manage our emotions and we develop behaviors of suppression, denying, ignoring, isolating, and habits of distraction like eating. In order to better cope with our emotions, Dr. Brackett argues we need ”permission to feel”. We need somebody to create safe conditions for us to experience and express our emotions. Dr. Brackett calls that person an Emotion Mentor, and says they needs three qualities:
            <ol>
                <li>Be nonjudgmental</li>
                <li>Be an active listener</li>
                <li>Be compassionate</li>
            </ol>
            In a similar narrative, Dr. Becky Kennedy has a parenting book called “Good Inside” in which she argues that emotional regulation (the last “R” of RULER) is the most important skill for a parent to teach their child. Dr. Kennedy explains that children learn emotional regulation by modeling their parents’ behavior. For instance, when a child is emotionally disregulated - meaning their emotions are overwhelming their bodies and exploding in uncontrollable behavior -  the parent must maintain their composure and establish a presence of, calm, in-control authority. This position from a parent demonstrates to the child that their emotions are not overwhelming to the parent and, therefore, are possible to be managed.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Kennedy offers this three-step process to regulating our emotions:
            <ol>
                <li>Acknowledge the emotion (Ex. saying out loud, “hello, anxiety”)</li>
                <li>Validate the emotion (Ex. Saying out loud, “I’m feeling anxious, this makes sense given the situation”)</li>
                <li>Permit the emotion (allow yourself to feel it, don’t ignore or suppress it, say “I can cope with it“)</li>
            </ol>
            I find the study of emotions fascinating and will continue to learn more about the topic. Reflecting on my personal experience with emotional intelligence, I would say I didn’t have an Emotion Mentor (according to Dr. Brackett, 70% of adults didn’t have one). I managed my emotions using isolation and eating copious amounts of Smartfood popcorn. Growing up I struggled with low emotional intelligence, a fixed mindset, and a cynical worldview. Not the best cards to play with. Over the years I’ve worked to improve my EQ, adopt a growth mindset, and reverse my cynical perspective. I enjoy learning the psychology behind these topics so I can better understand my past and apply the learnings and takeaways to improve my future.
