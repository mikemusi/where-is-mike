            <h2>Emotional Intelligence </h2>
            <h3>September 11, 2024</h3>
            <p>
            According to Dr. Marc Brackett’s, the Director of the Yale Center of Emotional Intelligence, Emotional intelligence is how we reason with and about our emotional feelings. Emotional intelligence can also be thought of as a set of skills, summarized by the acronym RULER:
            <ul>
                <li>Recognizing emotions - reading them in yourself and in others</li>
                <li>Understanding emotions - understand where they are coming from and their consequence</li>
                <li>Labeling emotions - being precise with the words we use to describe our feelings</li>
                <li>Expressing emotions - knowing how and when to express emotions to different people</li>
                <li>Regulating emotions - the strategies we use to manage daily emotions</li>
            </ul>
            When we don’t have these skills, we can’t manage our emotions and we develop behaviors of suppression, denying, ignoring, isolating, and habits of distraction like eating. In order to better cope with our emotions, Dr. Brackett argues we need ”permission to feel”. We need somebody to create safe conditions for us to experience and express our emotions. Dr. Brackett calls that person an Emotion Mentor, and says they needs three qualities:
            <ol>
                <li>Be nonjudgmental</li>
                <li>Be an active listener</li>
                <li>Be compassionate</li>
            </ol>
            In a similar narrative, Dr. Becky Kennedy has a parenting book called “Good Inside” in which she argues that emotional regulation (the last “R” of RULER) is the most important skill for a parent to teach their child. Dr. Kennedy explains that children learn emotional regulation by modeling their parents’ behavior. For instance, when a child is emotionally disregulated - meaning their emotions are overwhelming their bodies and exploding in uncontrollable behavior -  the parent must maintain their composure and establish a presence of, calm, in-control authority. This position from a parent demonstrates to the child that their emotions are not overwhelming to the parent and, therefore, are possible to be managed.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Kennedy offers this three-step process to regulating our emotions:
            <ol>
                <li>Acknowledge the emotion (Ex. saying out loud, “hello, anxiety”)</li>
                <li>Validate the emotion (Ex. Saying out loud, “I’m feeling anxious, this makes sense given the situation”)</li>
                <li>Permit the emotion (allow yourself to feel it, don’t ignore or suppress it, say “I can cope with it“)</li>
            </ol>
            I find the study of emotions fascinating and will continue to learn more about the topic. Reflecting on my personal experience with emotional intelligence, I would say I didn’t have an Emotion Mentor (according to Dr. Brackett, 70% of adults didn’t have one). I managed my emotions using isolation and eating copious amounts of Smartfood popcorn. Growing up I struggled with low emotional intelligence, a fixed mindset, and a cynical worldview. Not the best cards to play with. Over the years I’ve worked to improve my EQ, adopt a growth mindset, and reverse my cynical perspective. I enjoy learning the psychology behind these topics so I can better understand my past and apply the learnings and takeaways to improve my future.
